## 2. Core Workflows

### 2.1 Managing Data Sources
Navigate to the **Data** page to manage your primary research materials.

-   **Upload PDF**: Click "Upload Source" to add policy documents, whitepapers, or academic articles.
    -   *Supported Formats*: PDF
    -   *Limit*: 10MB per file
-   **Add URL**: Paste a link to a web page to scrape its content.
-   **Indexing**: Once uploaded, your document is automatically text-extracted and indexed for analysis.

### 2.2 Running Analysis
Once a source is available, you can apply theoretical lenses to it.

1.  Select a source from the list.
2.  Choose an **Analysis Mode**:
    -   **Situated Teleology**: What is the stated goal of this document vs. its actual effect?
    -   **Normative Attractors**: What "should" be true according to this text?
    -   **Colonial Blind Spots**: Whose voice is missing?
3.  Click **Analyze**.
    -   *Cost*: 1 Credit per analysis.
    -   *Time*: 30-60 seconds.

### 2.3 The Ecosystem Map
The **Ecosystem** page is the heart of instantTEA. It visualizes the actors and relationships you have traced.

-   **Nodes (Actors)**: Entities found in your texts (e.g., "European Commission", "High-Risk AI System").
-   **Edges (Relations)**: How these actors interact (e.g., "regulates", "prohibits").
-   **Side Panels**:
    -   **Left Panel (Actors)**: List of all identified actors. Click to filter the graph.
    -   **Right Panel (Analysis)**: Detailed breakdown of the selected actor's capacities and mechanisms.
    -   *Default State*: Both panels are open to help you orient yourself immediately.

## 3. Advanced Features

### 3.1 Comparative Synthesis
Use the **Synthesis** page to compare two or more documents.
-   Select Source A and Source B.
-   The AI will generate a report highlighting:
    -   **Divergent Definitions**: How do they define "Risk" differently?
    -   **Conflict Points**: Where do their policies clash?

### 3.2 Assemblage Mechanisms
Dive deeper into how the network stabilizes.
-   **Territorialization**: Processes that stabilize the identity of the assemblage (e.g., strict legal definitions).
-   **Deterritorialization**: Forces that destabilize or open up the assemblage (e.g., ambiguous language, new technologies).

## 5. FAQ

**Q: Is my data used to train AI models?**
A: **No.** We strictly segment user data and do not use it for model training.

**Q: Can I export my graph?**
A: Yes. On the Ecosystem page, specific export options allow you to download the graph data as JSON or CSV.

**Q: What is "Demo Mode"?**
A: If you see a notification about "Demo Mode," it means you are viewing a read-only version of the app. You can explore data but cannot upload files or spend credits.
