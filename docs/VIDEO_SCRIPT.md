# Video Script: Situatedness in Global AI Governance

**Target Audience:** Academic researchers, specifically for the "Algorithmic Assemblages" Special Issue.
**Tone:** Professional, insightful, yet accessible.
**Duration:** Approx. 3-4 minutes.

---

## Scene 1: Introduction (The Problem)
**Visual:** Montage of news headlines about the EU AI Act, Brazil's PL 2338, and chaotic social media feeds about AI.
**Audio (Voiceover):**
"Global AI governance is not a monolith. It is a fractured landscape of competing values, distinct cultural assumptions, and divergent institutional logics."
"To understand it, we need more than just text search. We need to 'zoom in' on the micro-discursive traces and 'zoom out' to the macro-level ecosystem."
"We need a computational hermeneutic instrument."

## Scene 2: The Solution (System Overview)
**Visual:** Screen recording of the **Data Page**. Cursor hovers over "Add Document" and "Add from URL".
**Audio:**
"Introducing the *Situatedness Research Platform*—a tool designed to map the 'algorithmic assemblages' of global AI governance."
"It begins with the **Discursive Field**. Researchers can ingest policy documents, white papers, and now—live web content—to build a rich corpus of data."

## Scene 3: Interpretive Analysis (Cultural & Institutional)
**Visual:** Split screen. Left side: **Cultural Framing** analysis of the EU AI Act. Right side: **Institutional Logics** analysis of Brazil PL 2338.
**Audio:**
"But data is nothing without interpretation."
"The system applies specific theoretical lenses. Here, we see **Cultural Framing** analysis, revealing how the EU constructs AI primarily as a 'Risk' to be managed..."
"...while in Brazil, we might see a tension between 'State' and 'Market' logics."
"This isn't just keyword counting; it's deep, LLM-driven hermeneutic analysis."

## Scene 4: Legitimacy & Justification (New Feature)
**Visual:** **Comparison Page**, clicking the "Legitimacy" tab. Showing the **Radar Charts** (Orders of Worth).
**Audio:**
"New to the platform is **Legitimacy Analysis**, grounded in Boltanski and Thévenot’s *Orders of Worth*."
"We can visualize the moral justifications used by actors. Does a policy appeal to 'Industrial' efficiency? 'Civic' solidarity? Or 'Market' competition?"
"These radar charts make the invisible moral architecture of the field visible."

## Scene 5: Comparative Synthesis (New Feature)
**Visual:** Clicking the **"Synthesize"** button on the Comparison Page. The AI generates the Executive Summary and Matrix.
**Audio:**
"Comparing these complex documents manually is exhaustive. The **Comparative Synthesis** engine changes that."
"It aggregates the cultural, institutional, and legitimacy analyses across documents to generate a high-level synthesis."
"It identifies divergent assumptions and conflicting logics, providing a 'qual-quant' matrix that accelerates cross-case analysis."

## Scene 6: Ecosystem & Cultural Holes
**Visual:** **Ecosystem Page**. Showing the network graph of actors. Then clicking "Visualize Cultural Holes" to show the DALL-E generated image/chart.
**Audio:**
"Finally, we map the **Ecosystem**."
"We trace the relationships between policymakers, startups, and civil society."
"And using Generative AI, we visualize **'Cultural Holes'**—the negative space in the network where connections *should* exist but don't."
"This visual artifact captures the structural disconnects in the assemblage."

## Scene 7: Conclusion
**Visual:** The "Algorithmic Assemblages" CFP title card, fading to the tool's logo/landing page.
**Audio:**
"From micro-resistance to macro-structures, this system offers the 'interpretive approach' called for by the *Algorithmic Assemblages* special issue."
"It is not just a tool for analysis; it is a platform for theory construction."
