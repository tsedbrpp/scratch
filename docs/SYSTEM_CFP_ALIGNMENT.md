# System Alignment: Algorithmic Assemblages & Interpretive Research

**Target Journal:** Information and Organization (Special Issue)
**Submission Deadline:** 15 May 2026

## Executive Summary
**Assemblage-AI** is designed as a "computational hermeneutic instrument" specifically tailored to meet the objectives of the Special Issue on **Algorithmic Assemblages**. It bridges the gap between macro-level ecosystem analysis and micro-level discursive interpretation, directly addressing the editors' call for innovative, mixed-method approaches.

## 1. Mapping Algorithmic Assemblages
**CFP Requirement:** Research that connects "mezzo/macro constructs (fields, ecosystems) with micro-dynamics" and explores "discursive and material interconnections."

### System Demonstration
*   **Ecosystem Visualization:** The platform dynamically renders the "field" as a network of heterogeneous actors. Crucially, it models **Algorithms** and **Datasets** as active participants alongside Policymakers and Startups, visualizing the "sociotechnical assemblage" rather than just a social network.
*   **Materiality:** By explicitly including "Infrastructure" and "Dataset" nodes, the system traces the material dependencies of AI governance—showing how policy debates cluster around specific technical artifacts (e.g., *The EU AI Act* assemblage vs. *The GPT-4* assemblage).
*   **Connection Logic:** The `getLinkLabel` function (e.g., "Trained On", "Governs", "Audits") operationalizes the *relational* nature of these assemblages, defining the specific verbs that bind human and non-human actors together.

## 2. Interpretive & Discursive Analysis
**CFP Requirement:** "Interpretive research" on how algorithms influence "meaning construction" and "organizational sensemaking."

### System Demonstration
*   **Hermeneutic Lenses:** The system does not just "process" text; it *interprets* it through specific theoretical lenses.
    *   **Decolonial Critique:** Reveals how "universal" AI safety standards may marginalize Global South epistemologies.
    *   **Institutional Logics:** Maps the tension between "Market Logic" (innovation, competition) and "Civic Logic" (rights, fairness).
*   **Cultural Holes Analysis:** This novel feature visualizes the *absence* of meaning. By detecting "structural holes" between discursive clusters (e.g., between EU regulators and Brazilian activists), it identifies opportunities for "bridging concepts"—directly answering the call to understand how meaning is constructed (or blocked) across fields.

## 3. Methodological Innovation
**CFP Requirement:** "Innovative interpretive methods," "computational discourse analysis," and "visualization."

### System Demonstration
*   **Generative "Biographies":** The **Timeline** feature (planned/in-progress) allows researchers to trace the "biography" of an algorithm—from its initial academic paper, through its commercial deployment, to its eventual regulation.
*   **Qual-Quant Synthesis:** The platform embodies the "Qual-Quant" approach by combining:
    *   **Qualitative:** LLM-generated "thick descriptions" of policy documents.
    *   **Quantitative:** Network metrics (centrality, density) of the ecosystem graph.
*   **Visual Artifacts:** The dynamic, interactive dashboard serves as a "visual artifact" itself, allowing researchers to manipulate the assemblage in real-time to test different theoretical hypotheses (e.g., "What happens if we remove the 'Open Source' node?").

## 4. Addressing the "Relational Turn"
**CFP Requirement:** Focus on the "relational turn" in studying technology and organizing.

### System Demonstration
*   **From Entities to Relations:** The system's ontology prioritizes *relationships* over attributes. An actor is defined not just by its type, but by its position in the network—its "situatedness."
*   **Micro-Resistance:** The **Resistance Analysis** module (part of the "Micro" suite) specifically looks for "counter-conduct" and "micro-resistance," tracing how local actors resist or reshape the macro-level algorithmic assemblage.

## Conclusion
**Assemblage-AI** is not merely a tool for data collection; it is a **methodological prototype** for the kind of research this Special Issue seeks to promote. It operationalizes "assemblage theory" into a working software artifact, allowing researchers to *see*, *touch*, and *analyze* the complex entanglements of code, culture, and power.
