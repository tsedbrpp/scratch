# Summary: Algorithmic Assemblages—Fields, Ecosystems, and Platforms

**Submission Deadline:** 15 May 2026
**Journal:** Information and Organization (Special Issue)

## Overview
This Special Issue invites interpretive research on **algorithmic assemblages** within fields, ecosystems, and platforms. It seeks to bridge **organization theory** and **information systems** to understand how algorithmic technologies shape and are shaped by these broader organizing structures.

## Key Themes & Objectives
The issue focuses on the "relational turn" in studying technology and organizing, specifically:
- **Macro-Micro Connection:** Connecting mezzo/macro constructs (fields, ecosystems) with micro-dynamics (routines, interactions).
- **Discursive & Material Interconnections:** How algorithms enable connections in ecosystems and facilitate legitimacy in fields.
- **Meaning Construction:** How algorithms circumscribe meaning across global fields and societies.

## Guest Editors
1.  **Timothy Hannigan** (University of Ottawa)
2.  **P. Devereaux Jennings** (University of Alberta)
3.  **Shaila Miranda** (University of Arkansas)
4.  **Samer Faraj** (McGill University)

## Suggested Topics
Papers may explore:
- Algorithmic technologies enabling discursive/material interconnections in ecosystems.
- Platforms as lenses for connecting different levels of field phenomena.
- Algorithmic influence on organizational sensemaking and "seeing" in fields.
- "Biographical" approaches to algorithmic assemblages via relational ethnography.
- Innovative interpretive methods (e.g., latent class analysis, computational discourse analysis, visualization).

## Methodology
The editors encourage **mixed methods** and innovative designs, including:
- Relational ethnography
- "Biographies" of algorithms
- Qual-quant mixed methods
- Computational techniques applied to interpretive research
