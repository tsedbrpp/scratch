# System Function: Decolonial Situatedness in Global AI Governance Research Platform

This application is a specialized research instrument designed to operationalize the **Decolonial Situatedness Framework (DSF)** for analyzing global AI governance. Unlike standard legal compliance tools, it functions as an "epistemic lens," revealing the hidden structural power dynamics, cultural assumptions, and colonial legacies embedded within policy texts (e.g., the EU AI Act, Brazil’s PL 2338).

## Core Capabilities

**1. Multi-Lens Algorithmic Analysis**
The system employs advanced LLM-driven qualitative analysis to interpret documents through distinct theoretical frameworks:
*   **Institutional Logics:** Identifies conflicting values (Market vs. State vs. Community).
*   **Cultural Framing:** Exposes regionally specific assumptions about technology and rights.
*   **Legitimacy Dynamics:** Maps the moral justifications (Orders of Worth) used to defend authority.

**2. Ecosystem & Assemblage Mapping**
It visualizes governance not as static text, but as active "assemblages." The **Ecosystem Impact Map** traces how specific policy mechanisms (e.g., "sandboxes") constrain or afford possibilities for diverse actors, distinguishing between material infrastructures and discursive norms.

**3. Comparative Synthesis**
The platform features a **Convergence/Divergence Engine** that quantifies the "epistemic distance" between frameworks. It generates "Coloniality Scores" to highlight where Global North standards may be overshadowing local contexts, visualizing these asymmetries via radar charts and synthesis matrices.

**4. Empirical Grounding (Micro-Resistance)**
To counter abstract high-level rhetoric, the system integrates an **Empirical Traces** engine. It searches live data sources (forums, Reddit) to find "micro-resistances"—real-world examples of how workers and communities subvert or navigate algorithmic control (e.g., "gambiarra" or workarounds), grounding theory in lived experience.
Ultimately, this system transforms static policy analysis into a dynamic, comparative critique, empowering researchers to challenge hegemonic norms in global AI governance.
