# Assemblage AI: Research Workflow

This guide outlines the recommended workflow for conducting critical analysis of complex narratives using **Assemblage AI**.

## Overview

The system is designed to guide you from raw data collection to high-level synthesis through a multi-layered analytical process:

1.  **Data Collection** (Ingest & Trace)
2.  **Micro Analysis** (Resistance & Reflexivity)
3.  **Meso Analysis** (Ecosystem & Networks)
4.  **Macro Analysis** (Governance & Culture)
5.  **Synthesis** (Comparison & Reporting)

## Phase 1: Data Collection

### 1.1 Documents (`/data`)
**Goal**: Build your primary archive.
-   **Upload**: Add PDF documents (policies, reports, whitepapers).
-   **Metadata**: Tag documents with jurisdiction, date, and type.
-   **Processing**: The system automatically extracts text for analysis.

### 1.2 Empirical Traces (`/empirical`)
**Goal**: Ground your analysis in real-world evidence.
-   **Search**: Use the integrated web search to find forum posts, news articles, and discussions.
-   **Capture**: Save relevant "traces" that evidence resistance or specific cultural attitudes.
-   **Link**: Connect these traces to your primary documents.

---

## Phase 2: Micro Analysis

### 2.1 Resistance (`/resistance`)
**Goal**: Identify agency and counter-conduct.
-   **Analyze**: Use AI to detect specific strategies of resistance (e.g., *Gambiarra*, Obfuscation, Refusal) within your traces.
-   **Catalog**: Build a library of resistance tactics used by actors in the system.

### 2.2 Critical Reflection (`/reflexivity`)
**Goal**: Maintain epistemic vigilance.
-   **Journal**: Document your own assumptions and biases.
-   **Challenge**: Use the AI to challenge your interpretations and suggest alternative viewpoints.

## Phase 3: Meso Analysis

### 3.1 Ecosystem (`/ecosystem`)
**Goal**: Map the network of actors.
-   **Simulate**: Generate a social graph of key actors (regulators, corporations, civil society).
-   **Analyze**: Identify "cultural holes" (disconnects) and "bridging" opportunities.
-   **Visualize**: View the dynamic network graph to understand power distribution.

### 3.2 Concept Network (`/ontology`)
**Goal**: Map the landscape of ideas.
-   **Extract**: Identify key concepts and terms from your documents.
-   **Connect**: Visualize how these concepts relate to one another (e.g., "Safety" vs. "Innovation").

---

## Phase 4: Macro Analysis

### 4.1 Governance (`/governance`)
**Goal**: Understand structural power.
-   **Orchestration**: Analyze how resources (funding, authority, data) are distributed.
-   **Logics**: Identify the dominant institutional logics (e.g., Market, State, Profession) driving policy.

### 4.2 Cultural Framing (`/cultural`)
**Goal**: Decode the narrative.
-   **Framing**: Analyze how problems are defined and solutions are justified.
-   **Epistemic Authority**: Determine whose knowledge is valued and whose is marginalized.

### 4.3 Timeline (`/timeline`)
**Goal**: Track temporal evolution.
-   **History**: Visualize key events and policy shifts over time.
-   **Dynamics**: Understand the speed and direction of change.

---

## Phase 5: Synthesis

### 5.1 Comparison (`/comparison`)
**Goal**: Side-by-side analysis.
-   **Compare**: Select two frameworks (e.g., EU AI Act vs. Brazil PL 2338) and analyze their differences in specific dimensions (e.g., Risk Definition, Enforcement).

### 5.2 Synthesis (`/synthesis`)
**Goal**: Generate insights.
-   **Report**: Use the AI to generate comprehensive reports that synthesize findings from all previous phases.
-   **Export**: Download your analysis for publication or sharing.

## Tips for Success

*   **Iterate**: Research is non-linear. Move back and forth between phases as you discover new evidence.
*   **Ground**: Always link your high-level claims back to specific empirical traces or document text.
*   **Reflect**: Use the Reflexivity tool regularly to ensure your analysis remains critical and self-aware.
